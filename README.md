I'm an experienced IT professional with a proven track record of delivering high-quality technical solutions and implementations to clients in a variety of industries. My expertise lies in system engineering, network design, and delivering bleeding-edge IT solutions that enhance organizational efficency.

<h3>üìà Career Journey </h3>
My passion for technology was sparked early, when I became my family‚Äôs unofficial ‚ÄúGeek Squad‚Äù technician‚Äîsolving common household tech issues like removing persistent LimeWire pop-ups. This curiosity laid the foundation for a lifelong journey in IT.

I trained as an IT Specialist at the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence in Fort Gordon, Georgia, where I developed a strong foundation in military-grade IT practices and infrastructure.

Upon completing my military training, I returned home and pursued an Associate's Degree while continuing to self-educate in the ever-evolving field of information technology. Motivated by a desire for continuous improvement and technical excellence, I went on to hold multiple IT engineering roles across diverse industries‚Äîeach position deepening my expertise in systems administration, networking, cloud services, and business technology consulting.
